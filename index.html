        <h1>How Git works</h1>
        <p>Here is a basic overview of how Git works:<br>

            Create a repository in GitHub<br>
            Initialize Git in your project<br>
            Add and commit your project<br>
            Push your project to GitHub<br>
            Add and remove a file from a repository</p>
        
        
        <h1>Step 1. Create the repository</h1>
        <p>Initially, the repository you create is going to be empty without any code in it. That's okay because you will start adding some files to it soon. This repository will be the central repository for your files, which means that others can access that repository if you give them permission. After creating a repository, you'll copy a version to your local system—that way you can update it from one repo, then transfer those changes to the other.

        <h1>Step 2. Initialize Git in Project</h1>
        <p>We can't make use of Git in our project if we do not initialize/start it first with the git init command.

            So after creating the repository in GitHub, I'll open the project in my VS Code editor, go to my terminal, and then use the git init command to initialize/start.
            
            When you run this command in your terminal, you will notice some changes in color in your project. You will also see a U symbol which means your files are untracked.
            
            Also, when you open the folder where your project is stored/located, you will see another folder named .git which was automatically created when you ran the git init command.</p>
        
        <h1>Step 3. Add and Commit your Project</h1>
        <h2>How to use the git add command</h2>  
        <p>Adding the project to the staging area helps Git track your project and see changes you have made to it.

            To add your project to the staging area, run the git add . command. When you run this command, you will see that the U symbol automatically changes to A. This means that your files have been added to the staging area and are now being tracked by Git, waiting to be committed.</p>

        <h2>How to use the git commit command</h2>
        <p>By running the git commit command, you are saving this particular stage and t he changes to your project permanently in the Git repository. And although you might make few changes to the project in the future and commit them as well, this particular commit you made now will still be saved in the Git repository and can be accessed anytime.

            So after your project has been added to the staging area, the next thing you'll want to do is commit it by using the git commit –m “first commit” command.
            
            When you run this command, you should notice that the A symbol in the project in no longer there, and the project looks as you'd expect once again.</p>
