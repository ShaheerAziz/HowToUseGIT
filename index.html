    <h1>How Git works</h1>
    <p>Here is a basic overview of how Git works:<br>

        Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)<br>
        Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine<br>
        Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes<br>
        "Push" your changes to your main branch<br>
        Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit<br>
        "Pull" the changes to your local machine<br>
        Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change<br>
        Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)<br>
        "Merge" your branch to the main branch</p>
    
    <br><br>
    <h1>Step 1. Create the repository</h1>
    <p>Initially, the repository you create is going to be empty without any code in it. That's okay because you will start adding some files to it soon. This repository will be the central repository for your files, which means that others can access that repository if you give them permission. After creating a repository, you'll copy a version to your local systemâ€”that way you can update it from one repo, then transfer those changes to the other.
